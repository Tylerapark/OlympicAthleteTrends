# OlympicAthleteTrends
This project analyzes Olympic athlete data from 1896 to 2016, exploring trends in age, gender, sport, and country. It answers questions about participation, medal counts, and athlete demographics to uncover insights useful for sports marketing, sponsorship targeting, and performance analysis.


## Analyzing Olympic athlete data to uncover trends in:
- Age
- Gender
- Performance
- Participation from 1896 to 2016.

This project explores how demographic factors relate to medal outcomes and how athlete profiles have evolved across sports and countries.

## Project Overview

Using the SportStat Olympic dataset, this analysis answers key questions:

- What is the average age of medalists over time?
- How has gender distribution changed by year?
- Which countries and sports dominate medal counts?
- How do height, weight, and age vary by sport?
- What are the participation trends across Olympic years?

## Methods

- Data cleaning: handled missing values, standardized text, removed duplicates
- Grouping and aggregation: used pandas for statistical summaries
- Visualization: built with seaborn and matplotlib to highlight trends
- Focused on practical insights for sports marketing and sponsorship

## Visual Insights

- Athlete gender trends across decades
- Medal distributions by country, sport, and year
- Age and body metrics comparison by sport
- Youngest and oldest sports by average age
